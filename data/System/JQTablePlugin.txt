This *work-in-progress* _aims_ to be a 99% replacement for !TablePlugin. It requires Javascript
to be enabled in the browser, and does *not* fall back to TablePlugin, so only use it if you
are sure all users will have Javascript enabled.

This is a work in progress and it's not perfect yet; some notable omissions:
   1 Now sort icon in table headers (just click the header to sort)
   1 Some issues with sorting when there are multiple header rows
   1 Sort direction and initcolumns controls don't work
You can help improve it, please feel free to do so.

Sorting is done using the jQuery tablesorter plugin written by Christian Bach,
which is included.

---++ Usage

Install it; disable TablePlugin and enable this plugin. Click on column headers to sort.

See TablePlugin for other usage.

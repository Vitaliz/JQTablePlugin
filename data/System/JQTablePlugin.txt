%TOC%

This plugin does two things:
   1 If TablePlugin is enabled, it enhances TablePlugin with client-side column sorting (if Javascript is enabled)
   1 If !TablePlugin is _not_ enabled, it performs the same processing as TablePlugin except it does it in the browser.

Some notable omissions:
   * Sorting doesn't work correctly if you have multiple header rows

*when used without TablePlugin*
   * No sort icon in table headers (just click the header to sort).
   * Sorting can be a bit strange when rowspans and colspans are used.
   * The sorted data background doesn't alternate if more than one colour is given.
   * The way column and row spans are calculated is slightly different to TablePlugin, which may give slightly different visual effect sin some extreme cases.

*when used with TablePlugin:*
   * Sorted column background doesn't work

You can help improve it, please feel free to do so.

Sorting is done using the jQuery tablesorter plugin written by Christian Bach,
which is included.

---++ Usage

If used with TablePlugin: Click on column headers to sort.

If used without TablePlugin: Behaviour should be identical to TablePlugin.

See TablePlugin for more information.
